UX & Product Designer

I am an aspiring UX and Product Designer trained through Google's UX
Design Certificate program. I specialize in creating intuitive
wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma and Adobe XD. My
work focuses on user-centered design principles, usability testing, and
accessible digital experiences. I combine strong visual design skills
with research-driven strategy to create meaningful, functional
interfaces.
